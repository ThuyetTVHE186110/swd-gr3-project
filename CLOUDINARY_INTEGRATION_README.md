## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Cloudinary Account

1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) and create a free account
2. Note down your credentials from the dashboard:
    - Cloud Name
    - API Key
    - API Secret

### 2. Configure Credentials

#### Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended)

Set these environment variables:

```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

**Windows:**

```cmd
setx CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME "your-cloud-name"
setx CLOUDINARY_API_KEY "your-api-key"
setx CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET "your-api-secret"
```

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME", "your-cloud-name", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CLOUDINARY_API_KEY", "your-api-key", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET", "your-api-secret", "User")
```

#### Option B: Properties File

Update `src/main/resources/cloudinary.properties`:

```properties
cloudinary.cloud_name=your-cloud-name
cloudinary.api_key=your-api-key
cloudinary.api_secret=your-api-secret
```

### 3. Restart Application

Restart your application server to load the new configuration.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Adding Products with Images

1. **Navigate to Admin Panel** ‚Üí Products
2. **Click "Add Product"** button
3. **Fill in product details** (name, price, stock, etc.)
4. **Choose image input method:**

#### Method 1: File Upload (Recommended)

-   Click on the "Upload File" tab (default)
-   Click the upload area or drag & drop an image file
-   Preview will appear immediately
-   File will be automatically uploaded to Cloudinary when you save

#### Method 2: Image URL

-   Click on the "Image URL" tab
-   Enter a direct link to an image file
-   Image will be used as-is from the provided URL

5. **Save the product** - the image will be processed and stored

### Updating Products

-   Edit any existing product
-   The same image input options are available
-   Uploading a new image will replace the existing one
-   Old images are automatically cleaned up from Cloudinary

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Cloudinary is NOT configured" Error

-   Check that your credentials are correctly set
-   Verify environment variables are loaded (restart IDE/terminal)
-   Ensure the cloudinary.properties file has valid credentials
-   Check the application logs for specific error messages

### Upload Fails with "Invalid image file"

-   Ensure file is a valid image format (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
-   Check file size is under 10MB
-   Try a different image file

### Upload Succeeds but Image Doesn't Appear

-   Check that the Cloudinary URL is being saved correctly in the database
-   Verify the image exists in your Cloudinary dashboard
-   Check browser console for any loading errors

### Performance Issues

-   Large files may take time to upload and process
-   Consider resizing images before upload for better performance
-   Cloudinary automatically optimizes images, but smaller source files help

## üìã Technical Details

### File Processing Flow

1. **Frontend Validation**: File type and size checked in browser
2. **Upload**: File sent as multipart form data to AdminServlet
3. **Server Validation**: File validated again on server side
4. **Cloudinary Upload**: File uploaded to Cloudinary with optimizations
5. **Database Storage**: Cloudinary URL saved in product record
6. **Cleanup**: Temporary files automatically cleaned up

### Image Optimizations Applied

-   **Size**: Limited to 800x800 pixels (maintains aspect ratio)
-   **Quality**: Automatic quality optimization
-   **Format**: Converted to optimal format for web delivery
-   **Compression**: Lossless compression applied

### Security Measures

-   File type whitelist (only image formats allowed)
-   File size limits enforced
-   Content-Type validation
-   Secure upload URLs from Cloudinary
-   XSS protection on all form inputs

## üîÑ Migration from URL-Only System

If you have existing products with image URLs:

1. **No immediate action required** - existing URLs will continue to work
2. **To migrate to Cloudinary**: Edit each product and re-upload the image
3. **Bulk migration**: Custom script can be created if needed (contact development team)

## üìû Support

For technical issues:

1. Check the application logs for error details
2. Verify Cloudinary dashboard for upload status
3. Test with different image files to isolate issues
4. Refer to [Cloudinary documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation) for advanced features

---

**Note**: The system maintains full backward compatibility. Products can still be created/updated with image URLs if needed, while new file upload functionality provides a better user experience.
